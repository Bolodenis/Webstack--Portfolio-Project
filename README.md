## About the Project
<span style="color:blue">**JiPLaN**</span> is a meal-planning application designed to simplify meal selection and promote healthy dietary habits. By leveraging randomization and user customization, JiPLaN solves the common dilemma of deciding what to eat. The app includes a pre-filled database of foods and allows users to add their own options. It categorizes meals into breakfast, lunch, dinner, and desserts while enabling users to track daily food expenses for better financial management.

## Learning Objectives
- Build intuitive and responsive UI/UX designs using modern tools.
- Strengthen backend skills with **SQLite**, **Flask**, and **RESTful APIs**.
- Explore **user authentication** and **data security mechanisms**.
- Integrate **third-party APIs** to extend app functionality.

## Technologies Used

### Frontend:
- **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**
- **Bootstrap** (for styling and responsive design)

### Backend:
- **Flask** (Python web framework)
- **Flask-RESTful API** (for API creation)

### Database:
- **SQLite** / **MySQL**

### Design Tools:
- **Figma** (for mockups)
- **Canva** (for branding and promotional content)

## Third-Party APIs
